# Create your own Creature

## Learning Goals
- **Plan first, code second!**
- Practice using the functions that we learned in class
- Practice working with the graphics coordinate system
- Use creativity to create your own masterpiece

## Your Creature
Design and create a creature. **You _must_ loosely sketch your creature on graph paper _before_ beginning to code.**

Your creature should have _at a minimum_:
- 1+ head(s)
- 1+ eye(s)
- 1 torso
- 2+ appendages

Additionally, it must:
- Use at least 3 different shapes
- Use at least 3 different colors
- Have at least 1 exact duplicate feature that is offset from the original (e.g. two identical legs that are 100 pixels apart)

You are encouraged to be creative and welcomed to use anything you find in the [p5.js documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/).

## Tips
- Run your program after every few lines to make sure you do not have typos and that it is functioning as you intend it to
- Pick a color scheme.
  - If you're not great at picking a color scheme (I'm not), then utilize a tool like [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com)
- Pick a few colors that you like and comment the RGB color codes at the top of your program so you don't forget what they are
  - Better yet, utilize [Color](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color) variables with meaningful variable names (not `c` like in the examples)!
- "Chunk" your code into meaningful sections like where you make the head, or the main body, or arms, etc.
  - Add a comment (e.g. `//head`) to each chunk of your code clearly describing what it does.
