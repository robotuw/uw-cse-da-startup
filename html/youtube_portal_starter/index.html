      <p>Rickrolling, alternatively rick-rolling, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up". The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink. Those led to the music video believing that they were accessing some unrelated material are said to have been rickrolled.[1] The trend has extended to disruptive or humorous appearances of the song in other situations, such as a live appearance of Astley himself in the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. <cite>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">Wikipedia</a>)</cite></p>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTIIMJ9tUc8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>"Tunak Tunak Tun" (Punjabi: ਤੁਣਕ ਤੁਣਕ ਤੁਣ) or simply "Tunak", is a bhangra/pop love song by Indian artist Daler Mehndi released in 1998. At the time, critics complained that Mehndi's music was only popular due to his videos that featured beautiful women dancing.[1] Mehndi's response was to create a video that featured only himself. The music video was the first made in India using greenscreen technology,[1] which allowed the singer to superimpose his image over various computer-generated backgrounds such as desert and mountain landscapes and St. Basil's Cathedral.</p>
      <p>The song and video was a success in India. It later became an international Internet meme. <cite>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunak_Tunak_Tun">Wikipedia</a>)</cite></p>
