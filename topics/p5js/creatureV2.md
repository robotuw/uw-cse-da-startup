# Creature Version 2.0

## Learning Goals
- Identify and build on programming patterns
  - In this case, use the background color changing example to change the robot's color instead
  - Also, use the keyPressed example to figure out how to create change on a mouse press
- Find built-in functions to use from p5.js's API
- Create and use functions to repeat similar code

## Modifying your Creature
1. Instead of chunking your code with whitespace and comments, chunk your code using functions that you define.
  - Make sure that your function names are meaningful
  - Make sure that you both define AND call your functions
  - Note that the order in which you call your functions is the order in which they execute (this affects layering!)
1. Make your creature change colors on a _key press_ instead of the background
1. Make your creature sleep (close eye(s) and anything else you want) when the _mouse is pressed_
1. Add a sky and 2+ clouds to the background of your sketch
  - You should _define your own cloud function that takes  parameters_ for where to place the cloud; optionally, you may also pass a variable height and width for your cloud
