# Creature Version 2.0

## Learning Goals
- Identify and build on programming patterns
  - In this case, use the background color changing example to change the robot's color instead
  - Also, use the keyPressed example to figure out how to create change on a mouse press as well
- Find a built-in function to use in p5.js's API
- Create and Use a function to repeat similar code

## Modifying your Creature
1. Make the creature follows your mouse
  - If the mouse pointer seems to be offset from your creature, figure out why and fix it
1. Instead of chunking your code with whitespace and comments, chunk your code using functions that you define.
  - Make sure that your function names are meaningful
  - Make sure that you both define AND call your functions
  - Note that the order in which you call your functions is the order in which they execute (this affects layering!)
1. Make your creature change colors on a keyPress instead of the background
1. Make your creature blink when the mouse is pressed
