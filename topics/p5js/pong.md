# Make Pong

## Learning Goals
- Combine your knowledge from the last few activities into one finished product
- Troubleshoot your own code

## Pong
Create the game of [Pong](https://pong-2.com/).

You should have:
1. Two paddles that move in unison north and south on the screen
  - Our version will not have a computer AI that a player plays against, but instead will be a single player game where the player must bounce the ball on both sides of the screen
  - The paddles should not be able to move off the screen
1. A ball that moves back and forth on the screen, either bouncing on the paddles or going off the screen if missed
  - When the ball bounces off a paddle, it should change directions and travel at a random angle to the other side of the screen
  - If the ball hits the north or south wall, it should bounce by changing directions on the y-axis but continuing on the same x-axis
1. You should track and display the number of bounces before the ball is missed

## Extensions
What can you do to add some creativity to your game of Pong?
