## Sardines
Sardines is an active game that is played like hide and go seek â€” only in reverse! One person hides, and everyone else searches for the hidden person. Whenever a person finds the hidden person, they quietly join them in their hiding spot. Soon, the hidden group starts to look like a bunch of sardines!

Discuss as a group how to program your Edisons so that you can play a game of Sardines!
- Does everyone know and understand the rules?
- How will you determine who is the original sardine?
  - Every robot should have the ability to be a sardine or a searcher
- How will Edisons find each other?
- What will they do when they find each other?
- Can they know when only 1 Edison remains searching or the game is over?
