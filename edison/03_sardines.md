## Sardines
Sardines is an active game that is played like hide and go seek â€” only in reverse! One person hides, and everyone else searches for the hidden person. Whenever a person finds the hidden person, they quietly join them in their hiding spot. Soon, the hidden group starts to look like a bunch of sardines!

Let's discuss as a group how to program our Edisons so that we can play a big game of Sardines!
- What are the rules?
- How will we determine who is the original sardine?
- How will Edisons find each other?
- What will they do when they find each other?
- How will they know when only 1 Edison remains searching?
